 * Immutable review record for one exact, server-generated recommendation.

 * review; approval must not restart its validity period.
 *
 * This model does not persist records, enforce expiry, authenticate reviewers,
 * or deliver policies. Those responsibilities belong to later workflow layers.
 * An APPROVED record means human approval, not successful policy application.
 * An EXPIRED record does not remove a policy that was already applied.
