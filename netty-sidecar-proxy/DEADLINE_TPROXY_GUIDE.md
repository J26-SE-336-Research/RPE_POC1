# Deadline, cancellation, and TPROXY guide

This guide explains the current sidecar proxy in simple English. It is for the team that builds the proxy image and the team that configures Kubernetes traffic routing.

## The short version

- The API gateway sidecar starts a request chain. It creates one `Request_id` and one absolute deadline if they are missing.
- A service sidecar saves the chain headers when the request enters that service.
- The service application passes only `Request_id` on its outgoing HTTP calls. Its sidecar finds the saved headers and adds them to those calls.
- A sidecar can notice that the deadline has passed. It sets `deadlineExceded=true` and `cancellation_Triggered=true` in the chain state.
- The proxy passes that status on later calls and on responses. It does not stop application work or send a separate live cancellation message to a request that is already running.
- TPROXY rules and pod permissions send traffic through the proxy. They are deployment work, not configured by this Java program.

## The headers

Header names are kept as used by this project. HTTP header names are case-insensitive, but use the same spelling everywhere to make logs easier to read.

| Header | Example | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Request_id` | `80b...` | One unique ID for the whole request chain. The gateway proxy creates a UUID for a new chain. |
| `deadlinevalue` | `1790956805000` | One UTC Unix time in milliseconds. It is the latest time the chain should be handled. Every service uses the same value. |
| `deadlineExceded` | `false` | Becomes `true` after a sidecar detects that the deadline has passed. The header spelling is intentionally the current code spelling. |
| `cancellation_Triggered` | `false` | A signal that work should be cancelled or skipped where the application can do so. |

The gateway sidecar uses `DEFAULT_DEADLINE_MILLIS` to choose how far in the future to set a missing deadline. For example, a 5,000 millisecond setting means five seconds from the gateway's current system time. The resulting absolute deadline is then passed unchanged along the chain.

## One request, step by step

Imagine a client calls the API gateway, which calls Order, and Order calls Inventory.

1. The API gateway sidecar sees a new request without chain headers. With `PROXY_ROLE=gateway`, it creates a UUID, sets `deadlinevalue`, and initializes both flags to `false`.
2. TPROXY sends the request to its real destination. The proxy reads the original destination from the intercepted connection; the service does not have to change its destination to the proxy address.
3. The Order sidecar receives the request with all four headers. It saves a copy of the chain context in memory under `Request_id` and starts checking the deadline for this inbound request.
4. Order's application makes its Inventory call with just `Request_id`. In this project, the Order `RestTemplate` interceptor does that part.
5. The Order sidecar sees the ID-only call, finds the saved context, and adds the same deadline and current flags before forwarding it to Inventory.
6. Inventory's sidecar saves the inbound context too. Inventory's application can read `cancellation_Triggered` when the request arrives. The current Inventory example logs a cancellation signal; it does not stop its critical work.
7. If the deadline passes while Order is still handling the request, Order's sidecar marks its saved context as exceeded and cancelled. A later outbound call from Order will carry `true`.
8. If Inventory returns a response with cancellation or deadline status set, Order's sidecar saves that status and adds it to Order's response. The Order sidecar removes its saved context when that inbound request finishes.
9. The response travels back through the upstream sidecars. Each response handler can attach the status it knows for that request to the response going upstream.

The service application does not send the original inbound request back. HTTP already pairs a response with its request on the connection. The sidecar handling that response has the request ID and context saved by its request handler.

## What “cancellation” means here

The current proxy uses cancellation as an HTTP status signal. It does not kill a thread, close an in-flight backend connection, or send a new cancellation request to the backend.

For example, if Inventory started work before the deadline passed, changing a header in Order's memory later cannot change the headers Inventory already received. Inventory can learn about cancellation if:

- its request arrives with `cancellation_Triggered=true`, or
- a later request carries `true`, or
- its response path receives a cancellation status from a downstream service and passes it back in the response.

The application can choose to skip optional work when it sees the signal. Notification currently demonstrates skipping optional notification work. Work that is already running needs an additional design, such as polling a cancellation endpoint or a separate messaging channel, if it must learn about cancellation immediately.

## Required application change

The sidecar does the deadline and status propagation. The service application only needs to preserve `Request_id` on its outbound calls so the sidecar can find the right context.

In this project, Order does this with a request-scoped value and a `RestTemplate` interceptor. Do not copy a request ID into a global variable: concurrent requests would then use the wrong ID. Also make sure every HTTP client path used for downstream calls attaches the ID. A client that omits it will be rejected by a service sidecar when no matching context can be found.

Application cancellation handling is optional and specific to the work. A service can log the signal, skip optional work, or stop work that its own code can safely stop. The proxy only carries the signal.

## Proxy roles and settings

Set these values on each proxy container:

### API gateway sidecar

```text
PROXY_ROLE=gateway
PROXY_LISTEN_HOST=0.0.0.0
PROXY_LISTEN_PORT=15001
DEFAULT_DEADLINE_MILLIS=5000
```

Only this role may create a missing `Request_id` or `deadlinevalue`. It initializes missing flags to `false` and does not act as the service-side inbound deadline detector.

### Sidecar beside a normal service

```text
PROXY_ROLE=service
PROXY_LISTEN_HOST=0.0.0.0
PROXY_LISTEN_PORT=8080
PROXY_DETECT_INBOUND_DEADLINE=true
```

Service is the default role. A service sidecar must receive chain metadata on an inbound request. For an outbound request containing only `Request_id`, it must find the saved context. If the ID or context is missing, the current proxy returns HTTP 400; it does not invent a new deadline.

The context map is in the proxy process's memory. Each request chain must pass through the same service sidecar instance for its inbound request and its later outbound requests. Do not load-balance those two flows across different sidecars unless the context store is changed to shared storage.

`PROXY_DETECT_INBOUND_DEADLINE` is a proxy setting, not an instruction to create a new deadline. The current implementation schedules deadline detection for service-side inbound contexts. Confirm the setting and behavior against the exact proxy version being deployed.

## TPROXY: what the cluster team must arrange

TPROXY does not change the application's target address. It intercepts packets in Linux, gives them to the transparent listener, and keeps the packet's original destination available. The proxy then connects to that original destination.

In this repository's Kubernetes setup, inbound service traffic uses TPROXY in each pod's `mangle/PREROUTING` chain. Locally generated HTTP calls use `nat/OUTPUT` REDIRECT to the same sidecar listener; the proxy routes those requests using the HTTP `Host` authority. The proxy's Linux UID is excluded from that rule so its backend connection does not loop back into the sidecar. This egress path supports the HTTP/1.1 service calls on ports 8081–8084, not arbitrary TCP or TLS.

For the current code to work, all of these must be true:

1. The proxy runs on Linux with a supported Netty epoll native library. The provided shaded JAR includes Linux x86_64 and ARM64 epoll runtimes.
2. The sidecar listens on the port used by the traffic rules (`15001` for the API gateway in these Kubernetes manifests, `8080` for backend service sidecars).
3. The rules intercept the intended TCP traffic and deliver it to that port while preserving the original destination.
4. Policy routing marks and routes TPROXY packets locally, as required by Linux TPROXY.
5. Proxy connections to the original destination are excluded from interception, or they will loop back into the proxy.
6. The proxy container has the capability needed to set `IP_TRANSPARENT`. The Linux documentation says this normally requires `CAP_NET_ADMIN` or `CAP_NET_RAW`; use the narrowest capability accepted by your cluster and runtime.
7. The pod security policy, admission policy, and cluster runtime allow the required capability and network rules. Some clusters prohibit this. A privileged init container or node-level setup may be needed to install the rules; the proxy process itself should not receive broad privileges just to install rules if that can be avoided.

### Linux rule shape (example only)

The following is the standard shape of an IPv4 iptables TPROXY setup. It is a reference for the deployment engineer, not a ready-to-apply Kubernetes manifest. The real rule must match your CNI, pod network namespace, traffic direction, ports, health checks, and proxy UID.

```sh
# Example values only. Pick unused mark/table values and the real proxy port.
iptables -t mangle -N SIDECAR_TPROXY
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -j SIDECAR_TPROXY

# Add RETURN rules here for traffic that must not be intercepted:
# - traffic to/from the proxy itself
# - loopback and required Kubernetes/CNI traffic
# - excluded ports, destinations, and health checks

iptables -t mangle -A SIDECAR_TPROXY -p tcp \
  -j TPROXY --on-port 8080 --tproxy-mark 0x1/0x1

ip rule add fwmark 0x1/0x1 lookup 100
ip route add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100
```

This example shows the TPROXY packet delivery and policy-routing pieces. It does not define your complete pod egress setup. Locally-created pod traffic and traffic arriving from outside the pod enter different network paths; your team must add and test the correct capture and bypass rules for both directions. Do not copy this example unchanged into a cluster. In particular, wrong bypass rules can create a forwarding loop or intercept Kubernetes networking.

Use the equivalent nftables rules if your cluster uses nftables. Do not install both iptables and nftables rule sets without understanding how they interact.

### Pod permissions: example shape

The Kubernetes security context can grant a Linux capability to the proxy container. The example below shows the form only; your cluster security policy must allow it, and the cluster team must decide whether `NET_ADMIN` or `NET_RAW` is sufficient for this runtime and setup.

```yaml
containers:
  - name: sidecar-proxy
    image: your-proxy-image
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"] # Or the narrower capability proven sufficient in your environment.
```

If a separate init container installs iptables rules, it may need `NET_ADMIN` and the required iptables tools. Keep those rule-installing permissions separate from the long-running Java proxy when possible. Kubernetes clusters may reject these permissions through Pod Security Admission or a policy engine; that must be resolved by the cluster administrator.

## Safe rollout checklist

1. Check that the proxy starts on Linux and logs that it is listening on the configured port.
2. Confirm TPROXY and socket-match support in the node kernel, and that the required iptables extensions or nftables features are available.
3. Confirm `ip rule` and the local route table contain the mark and table used by the rules.
4. Send a request through the pod and confirm the proxy forwards it to the original service address, not back to itself.
5. Confirm the gateway proxy creates one ID and deadline, and service proxies preserve them.
6. Confirm an order downstream call contains the same `Request_id`, deadline, and current flags.
7. Use a short deadline and check proxy logs for deadline detection. Check service logs to see which applications received `cancellation_Triggered=true`.
8. Check both success and error paths. The proxy is a proof of concept and currently aggregates HTTP messages up to 10 MB and opens a backend connection per request.

## Current limits to remember

- This is an HTTP/1.1 proof of concept. It is not a full production service mesh proxy.
- The proxy aggregates messages (up to 10 MB) and opens one backend connection per request.
- It does not intercept HTTPS as readable HTTP. TLS interception or application-level TLS handling needs a separate design.
- It does not actively stop application work or notify already-running calls asynchronously.
- The deadline comparison uses each pod's system clock. Keep node clocks synchronized, for example with the cluster's NTP/chrony setup.
- Context is held in memory and is removed when the owning inbound request completes. Process restarts lose it.
- The proxy code does not install Linux rules or Kubernetes permissions.
